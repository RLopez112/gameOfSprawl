# GAME OF SPRAWL

## SEED
![alt text][laPlata_init]</br>

_"In 1889, seven years after its foundation, the City of La Plata obtained the 1st Prize at the Universal Exposition in Paris as «City of the future» and «Best Built Realization», an event that symbolized the consecration of new hygienist, positivist and republican ideas after the Industrial Revolution. More than 100 years later, faced with an overflowing and disoriented current scenario, we asked ourselves how to update the foundational plan by reinterpreting the grid in a completely different way with the only premise of operating with the unpredictable condition of what has not yet arrived."_ </br>

My train of thought started with [supraorder: La Plata]</br>
Seeing that the solution proposed for the future is replicating what was done a century ago poped some questions:
* The result would be the same?
* Could we state for sure that the initial point is the same?
* What shaped La Plata's footprint?
* How do we imagine it´s future footprint?
* How the result would be a century in the future?

In order to try answering this questions I believe that I'd need a tool that simulates the complexity of urban expantion. Quite an easy feat. <br/>
I belive that a nice place to start is [Michael Batty´s system]. Implementing it is way out of the question. However, implementing an diluted version with Conway´s Game of Life would be easier.
